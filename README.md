# GitHub Actions

To understand and learn about GitHub Actions:

After adding `.github/workflows/somefile.yml`, it turns yellow (pending: currently running workflow and checks code).

- It turns green if code checks pass.
- It turns red if code checks fail.

Go to the **Actions** tab in the repository to see workflow actions and their status (✅ / ❌).

- Under workflows, you can see the list of commits.
- Click on a commit to see the progress of the workflow.
